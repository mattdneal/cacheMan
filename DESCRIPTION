Title: In-Memory Function Call Caching
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Matthew Neal
Maintainer: Matthew Neal <mattdneal@gmail.com>
Description: cacheMan makes it simple to cache and retrieve the output of
    long-running functions in memory. Caches are passed between functions as a
    Cache object, so side-effects of function execution can be confined to the
    Cache object, without the need to set any global caching variables.
